# Deep-Symbolic-Learning
This project explores an intuitive unsupervised learning algorithm to accurately detect communities in a given image dataset using symbolic Identification (ID) assignment. Images are divided into grids of a specified nxn size and assigned  certain identification values through loose clustering techniques like K-Means. These ID's are then grouped into communities based on their spatial features to detect groups of ID's which are strongly coherent and which co-occur frequently. By analysing the Normalized point-wise mutual information of each co-occurring pair of ID's, we are able to build a model which is able to detect communities of coherent ID's which can be used to represent important features for the given image dataset. The model is tested for its scalability and accuracy with conventional learning algorithms such as to test whether it can adequately detect useful features from a seemingly random and unlabelled dataset.
